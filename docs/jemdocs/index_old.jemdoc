== Purpose
Most systems in day-to-day life are governed by partial differential equations.
Simple examples of this include the {{<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Bernoulli_beam_theory" target="_blank">Euler-beam</a>}} hinged at its two ends which is a crude approximation to a bridge, and
the {{<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier-Stokes_equations" target="_blank">Navier-Stokes</a>}} equations which exactly express the motion of a fluid like water. Frequency responses look at the responses of these physical systems to a persistent sinusoidal forcing. A good example of this is an opera singer trying to shatter a vine glass (I've taken the picture below from {{<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304141/" target="_blank">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>}}).

Another good example where frequency responses could have played a major role is the {{<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge" target="_blank">Tacoma bridge</a> incident}}.
The Tacoma bridge collapsed in 1940 after oscillating about 10-15 cycles a minute until it finally broke apart. The strong wind is said to have triggered the amplifying oscillations that finally led to the collapse of the bridge.

[index.html +SVDFR+] can solve for
singular values of frequency responses of a subset of linear partial
differential equations in time and one other spatial variable. The principal singular value computed in this manner is the largest possible amplification of the output for a unit input. The associated functions of the principal singular value give the shape of the input that can lead to the optimal output. We provide a few examples here that involve applications in physical
systems.

[/javascript:cite('liejovJCP13') Lieu and Jovanovic] originally started out this endeavor in using {{<a href="http://www.chebfun.org/" target="_blank">Chebfun's</a>}} automatic collocation in frequency response calculations. They used an integral reformulation to derive a well-conditioned numerical scheme to compute frequency responses. Over the years, {{<a href="http://www.chebfun.org/" target="_blank">Chebfun</a>}} has evolved substantially, the original version of SVDFR is no more maintained or updated. In contrast, the version presented here uses {{<a href="http://www.chebfun.org/" target="_blank">Chebfun's</a>}} built-in well-conditioned [/javascript:cite('OlvTowSIAM2013') ultraspherical method], and a robust feedback interconnected system (see the [/javascript:cite('harkumjovJCP21') accompanying paper] and [/javascript:cite('Boyd1989') Boyd]). Furthermore, the current version is updated to comply with the most recent release of {{<a href="http://www.chebfun.org/" target="_blank">Chebfun</a>}} (v5.7.0) and is designed to work directly with the {{<a href="http://www.chebfun.org/" target="_blank">Chebfun</a>}} syntax: /The end result as you will see in the examples is short and intuitive codes to compute frequency responses of relatively complex systems/.  

We also provide a routine to compute the $H_\infty$ norm of a linear system (the largest energy amplification among inputs of all temporal frequencies). We believe that most users familiar with {{<a href="http://www.chebfun.org/" target="_blank">Chebfun</a>}} can start using [index.html +SVDFR+] effortlessly.
