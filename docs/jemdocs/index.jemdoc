== Purpose
Most systems in day-to-day life are governed by partial differential equations.
Simple examples of this include the {{<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Bernoulli_beam_theory" target="_blank">Euler-beam</a>}} hinged at its two ends which is a crude approximation to a bridge, and
the {{<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier-Stokes_equations" target="_blank">Navier-Stokes</a>}} equations which exactly express the motion of a fluid like water. Frequency responses look at the responses of these physical systems to a persistent sinusoidal forcing. A good example of this is an opera singer trying to shatter a vine glass (I've taken the picture below from the movie {{<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304141/" target="_blank">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>}}).

Another good example where frequency responses could have played a major role is the {{<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge" target="_blank">Tacoma bridge</a> incident}}.
The Tacoma bridge collapsed in 1940 after oscillating about 10-15 cycles a minute until it finally broke apart. The strong wind is said to have triggered the unstable (amplifying) oscillations that finally led to the collapse of the bridge.

[index.html +SVDFR3+] can solve for
singular values of frequency responses of a subset of linear partial
differential equations in time and one other spatial variable. The principal singular value computed in this manner is the largest possible amplification of the output for a unit input. The associated singular functions of the principal singular value give the shape of the input that can lead to the optimal output. We provide a few examples here that involve applications in physical
systems.

The mathematical framework of [index.html +SVDFR3+] follows [http://people.ece.umn.edu/users/mihailo/software/chebfun-svd/index.html SVDFR] closely, but with an improved and a more robust algorithm. Furthermore, unlike [http://people.ece.umn.edu/users/mihailo/software/chebfun-svd/index.html SVDFR], [index.html +SVDFR3+] works with the most recent Chebfun and is designed to work directly with the Chebfun syntax. Most users familiar with using Chebfun can start using [index.html +SVDFR3+] effortlessly.
